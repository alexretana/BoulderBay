# Rock-Climbing-Showcase-Page

Purpose of this project is to gain skills in collaborating on a Project to achieve launching an interactive-webpage.

# Roadmap

On our first "sprint" we want to have a web page which is interacted with very simply. Here is the idea of the first potentially releasible product.

- One webpage client which asks the customer to either input City, or Zipcode
- Once submitted, the client will send a request to our backend database and return some information for all the gyms in a 100 mi radius:
    - Show the name
    - Show at least one picutre from the gym
    - Show the address of the gym
    - Give a Rating if applicable
- A static backend database that will be built using multiple data sources from online, and will be set to update weekly



More ideas will be added to a product backlog once significant progress is made on this product.

Potential Data Sources to Look into will be:
- [The Crag API](https://www.thecrag.com/api-wadl.xml)
- [Rock Climbing API -  Geocoder and Recommender](https://openbeta.io/api/)
- [Scrape from 'https://www.mountainproject.com/'](https://www.mountainproject.com/)
- [Google My Business API](https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/review-data)
- [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers)
